# Summer_Research_JWST_SIMP0136

I completed a summer research internship at Trinity College Dublin under Professor Johanna Vos. I learned and developed Python code to analyse data for a 12.7 Jupiter mass free-floating exoplanet SIMP0136 extracted from the James Webb Space Telescope under an exometeorology program conducted by Professor Vos.
